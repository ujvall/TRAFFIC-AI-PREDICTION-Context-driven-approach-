## High-Level Architecture

A **multi-model ensemble system** for real-time traffic congestion prediction. Four independent ML models each expose a FastAPI microservice. A central orchestrator detects the current traffic context, assigns weights to each model accordingly, and fuses their probability outputs into a single prediction.

## Services

### `models/markov_api.py` — port 8001
- Hardcoded 4×4 **Markov transition matrix** (states: free → moderate → heavy → jam)
- Adjusts row probabilities at inference time based on speed ratio, vehicle density, and adverse weather
- No training required; stateless

### `models/rf_api.py` — port 8002
- **RandomForestClassifier** (sklearn, 150 trees, depth 10)
- Trained at startup on 1000 synthetic samples that encode domain congestion rules
- Features: `[speed, vehicle_count, hour, weather_encoded, previous_state]`

### `models/lstm_api.py` — port 8003
- 1-layer **LSTM** (PyTorch, hidden=32) trained for 40 epochs at startup on 600 synthetic sequences of length 6
- Features per step: `[speed_norm, density_norm, hour_sin, hour_cos, weather_norm]`
- At inference, builds an artificial 6-step sequence with small Gaussian jitter from the single input snapshot

### `models/bayesian_api.py` — port 8004
- **Bayesian Network** (pgmpy) with structure: `Weather → Congestion ← TimeOfDay ← Density`
- 27-column hand-crafted CPT encoding domain knowledge
- Uses Variable Elimination at inference; inputs discretized into 3-level categories

## Ensemble Layer

### `ensemble/context_detector.py`
Detects one of 6 contexts (priority order):

1. `ACCIDENT_EVENT` — if `accident=True`
2. `WEATHER_EVENT` — if weather in `{rain, snow, fog}`
3. `MORNING_RUSH` — hour 7–10
4. `EVENING_RUSH` — hour 17–20
5. `NIGHT_LOW_TRAFFIC` — hour 0–5
6. `NORMAL_CONDITIONS` — default

### `ensemble/ensemble_engine.py`
Context-specific weight tables (sum to 1.0):

| Context | LSTM | RF | Markov | Bayesian |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Morning/Evening Rush | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
| Night | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.1 |
| Weather Event | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.5 |
| Accident | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
| Normal | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.1 |

`fuse()` computes weighted average over 4 probability vectors → argmax = predicted state; confidence = top-2 prob sum.

### `ensemble/tomtom_fetcher.py`
- Calls **TomTom Flow Segment API** for live speed + free-flow speed
- Calls **Open-Meteo** (free, no key) for weather via WMO codes
- Calls **TomTom Reverse Geocode** for street name
- Graceful fallback to deterministic synthetic data (seeded by lat/lon) if `TOMTOM_API_KEY` is unset

### `ensemble/main_api.py` — port 8000
Three prediction endpoints:

- `POST /predict_traffic` — manual JSON input
- `GET  /fetch_location?lat=&lon=` — raw live data from map click
- `POST /predict_from_map?lat=&lon=` — one-click: fetches live data then runs full ensemble
- `GET  /` — serves the interactive HTML/JS map UI from `static/index.html`

Generates a **natural language summary** of the result (which model led, why, confidence word, road conditions).

## Request / Response

### Input (`POST /predict_traffic`)

```json
{
  "road_id": 142,
  "avg_speed": 24,
  "vehicle_count": 210,
  "weather": "rain",
  "hour": 8,
  "previous_state": 2,
  "accident": false
}
```

### Output

  "predicted_state":      "heavy",
  "confidence":           0.75,
  "natural_language_summary": "At 8:00 AM, Road 142 is experiencing adverse weather conditions. Weather is rain, which is affecting road conditions. Current average speed is 24 km/h with 210 vehicles observed. The AI predicts that traffic is heavily congested — significant delays likely. The system is fairly confident about this (75% confidence). The Bayesian Network had the highest influence on this prediction (50% weight) because it is best at reasoning about weather and environmental factors. There is also a 30% chance of jam traffic conditions."

## Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: set TomTom key for live data
export TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Start all 5 services
bash run.sh
```

Services start in order: 4 model microservices (ports 8001–8004) → 5 s wait → ensemble orchestrator (port 8000).  
Each service exposes `/health` and `/docs` (Swagger UI).  
Stop all with `Ctrl-C`.
